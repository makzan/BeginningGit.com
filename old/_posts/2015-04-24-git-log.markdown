From time to time, you’ll want to check the commit logs. You may use `git log` to check the log.

There are different formats and filters you can apply to the log.

## Time for Action—Viewing log

1. Go into any working project with git version controlled.

2. View the log with `git log`

        $ git log
        
3. Use `--oneline` to view the log in minimal mode. (One line with only comment).

        $ git log --oneline 
        
    
## Exercise 1

I prepared a git repo with several commits. Please use `git log` to view the commits. Try exploring different flags to view the differences.
