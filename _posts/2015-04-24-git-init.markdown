We want to get started our first git version control repo. It’s as simply as calling `git init` in the working directory.

Then we can use `git status` at any moment to check the current tracking status. Usually, we would like to commit the files as initial commit.

## Time for Action—Init first git repo

1. `cd` into your working project.

2. Type `git init` to get started.
    
        $ git init
    
    
3. Check status: 

        $ git status
    

4. Add all files in current directory:

        $ git add .
    

5. Commit the changes with message.

        $ git commit -m "Init code with index.html"
    
    
## Exercise

In the following sandbox environment, try to commit the first file into the git repo.
