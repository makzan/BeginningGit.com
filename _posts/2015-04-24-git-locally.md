The easiest way to get started using git is to use it locally yourself. You don’t need to convince all your colleages. You don’t need to setup any server. You don’t need to create Github account. All you need to do is `git init` and then keep commiting the changes.

## Exercise 1

I prepared a git repo. Try to make some changes to the text files and commit the changes. Take a look at the log from time to time.
